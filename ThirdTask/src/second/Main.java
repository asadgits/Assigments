            Second.CompareToMethod();
//        compareTo() method first of all it works in lexicographically  order MEANS it compare words by picking one by one
//        when it starts comparing it gets first character of a String then compare it with first character of a Second
//        variable if thay are same in CASE and value it retruns 0 when variable has only one character

//        If variables had multiple characters firstly it compares first character of both variables if thay has same CASE and
//        value then it takes Second character and compares them if thay also has same case and value it takes third one
//        and compares it if third character has different case or value it returns its difference and stops the comperision and didnot
//        go further comperision of characters
